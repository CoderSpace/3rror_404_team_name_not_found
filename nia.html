            <h1>Nia's Page</h1>
            <p>Hello. My name is Nia, I am 14 years old and I like reading, writing(it's trash though), drawing, playing video games, coding games on Scratch, and sleeping. Mostly sleeping.</p>
            <p>I also like to listen to a lot of types of music, such as nightcore, dupstep, nightstep, and anything on YouTube I can find that's actually pretty good music. I absolutely hate 99% of what comes onto the radio, so I mostly try to keep it off unless I'm in a car that I'm not driving.</p>

            <p>This is a song I listen to when I need music for studying. It's an instumental.</p>

            <p>This is what i listen to when I have nothing to do.</p>
            <p>As you probably get the point, I have a song for everything. I like music a lot, but I wouldn't say that music is my life, because it isn't. Art is. There's a lot of good artists I watch on YouTube, and most of them do digital art. But there are the select few who do traditional art that I actually like. It's not that I don't like the good artists on YouTube, it's more of how the ones that I watch are pretty good because you can see them progress even if they don't.</p>
            <p>Anyway, now that I'm done with that, let's get into the fun stuff: books! I have a ton of books. I'm bieng super serious. I have two bookshelves to hold all my stuff, and I still don't have room for all of it. Even though I've given away all of my childhood books(which took up about two small boxes by the way), I still don't hve room. I want more books, but I'm not sure where I can actually put them.</p>
            <p>As for my writing... it's trash.</p>
            <p>Drawing is really fun to do, especially if you have great ideas and want to put them on paper right away, even if you never finish what you were working on previously. Most people are not satisfied with their art, including me. Most people are trying to aim for perfection, but I just want to get my anatomy straight before I move onto the next thing. Aiming for perfection with art will get you nowhere, and you will end up giving up on it and move onto a future job that you will not enjoy and spend the rest of your life in absolute misery... At least that's my opinion on it anyway.</p>
            <p>My favorite games are Fire Emblem Fates(both birthright and conquest), pokemon sun/moon. FEF:Birthright is basically every character anyone likes even a little bit(on both sides) all dying. In FEF:Conquest, everyone dies. 99% of everyone's favorite characters, a lot of extras, and the one character everyone doesn't like no matter what game he's in: King Garon. But both of them are pretty good strategy games. For instance, in all of your battles, you will be outnumbered by a lot. It's interesting to see how one would defeat an army larger than itself and winning. Pokemon sun/moon are both also strategy games, as you have to plan your moves and types before you actually start on a battle with either the island captain(s) and the island kahunas. And if you want to try, the totem pokemon as well need some planning before you go and try to catch them.</p>
            <p>In Scratch, it's not really coding as in typing in every line of code for this, but it's kind of like taking pre-made code and piecing it all together. The one game I actually have posted, is actually a draft. It doesn't always work, but when it does, it's actaully pretty boring, so I was going to try and add in something to make it something like Candy Crush: which has an actual goal. The other game that I haven't yet posted, is actually supposed to be a puzzle/adventure game. I had to draw in all of the characters in a pixelated version. It actually was supposed to be a school project, but it was becoming too complicated, and it wouldn't make the deadline. So now it's mostly a personal project.</p>
            <p>Bieng in school is a lot of stress in itself. I get max 3 hours of sleep a day during the school year, and this is mainly because of all the homework I have to do, plus all the chores I have to do after I'm done with that, and then there's always the stuff I have to worry about when I don't really need to worry about it. During the summer, if I don't have anything to do for a couple of weeks, I will always sleep from whatever time I go to sleep to about 2pm. So during the summer, I basically hibernate until I have to do something.</p>
            <p>That's all you need to know about me, so I'll leave it at this.</p>
